Chi-Square
==
Calculates a Chi-square distribution over a sequence of bytes within a Buffer.

The result is a float representing the probability of how frequently a truly random sequence of bytes would exceed the calculated value.

Ideally this float should have a value of 0.5. If so, the given Buffer contained random data.

Read on [Chi-square distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution) for more details.

## What's the point?

You can use this library to determine if your random data source produces good random data.
There are a wide variety of ways to measure random data quality (such as arithmetic mean, entropy frequencies, monte carlo simulations, etc.), but among all of them,
calculating the chi square distribution over the random data reveals much more.

## Installation

```npm install chi-square```

## Examples

```javascript
var chiSquare = require('chi-square'),
    crypto = require('crypto');

crypto.randomBytes(1024 * 1024, function(err, buffer) {
    if (err) throw err;

    console.log('The chi square distribution over the random data sequence was: %d', chiSquare.calculate(buffer));
});
```

The output was:

```
The chi square distribution over the random data sequence was: 0.36175185384825533
```

Since the output was quite close to 0.5, the distribution was quite uniform and thus the generated random data seems to be rather good.

Your results may vary based on the platform and other factors (the state used to generated seeds for instance).
